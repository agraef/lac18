# LAC 18 materials (Purr Data workshop)

This repository contains some links and files which will be useful if you want to follow along with my workshop [Getting Started with Purr Data](http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2018/pages/event/15/) at [LAC 2018](http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2018/) at Berlin.

- Paper (extended abstract): [pd-l2ork-workshop.pdf](pd-l2ork-workshop.pdf)
- Slides: [purr-data-slides.pdf](purr-data-slides.pdf)

During the workshop, we'll be installing [Purr Data](https://agraef.github.io/purr-data/) from source, available in this Git repository: <https://github.com/agraef/purr-data.git> (This points to Purr Data's official GitHub mirror. If you prefer, you can also use Jonathan Wilkes' upstream GitLab repository instead: <https://git.purrdata.net/jwilkes/purr-data>.)

Some examples to be discussed during the workshop can be found in the [examples](examples) folder.

**Media files:** For demonstration purposes, I'll be using [QSynth][]/[FluidSynth][] (readily available in most Linux distributions) along with a soundfont and some MIDI files, e.g.:

- [TimGM6mb.sf2](http://sourceforge.net/p/mscore/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/mscore/share/sound/TimGM6mb.sf2?format=raw)
- [bwv772.mid](http://www.jsbach.net/midi/bwv772.mid) (from [Dave's J.S. Bach Page](http://www.jsbach.net/))

The [MuseScore manual](https://musescore.org/en/handbook/soundfonts-and-sfz-files#list) has a reasonably comprehensive list of soundfonts freely available on the web, and some free quality soundfonts can be found [here](https://sites.google.com/site/soundfonts4u/).
